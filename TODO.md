- [X] lim x-> infty (e^x-1)/x = 1
- [X] lim x -> 0 sin(x^2) / x
Fall 2020)
- [X] rewrite the limit section


#### derivatives

- [X] Typo on Derivative C3
- [ ] Find vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes
- [X] add problems in derivatives with trig simplification first. e.g. $\frac{\sin(3x)}{\tan(7x)}$
- [ ] Make the condensed tables and the text tables match
- [X] add more inverse trig to exercises
- [X] logrithmic examples like $\sin(x^x)$
- [X] implicit differentiation by parametric curves
- [ ] Average rate of change
- [ ] Move LH rule to derivatives applications section on condensed
- [ ] look at graphs and draw derivatives (and sketching graphs)
- [ ] parametrically defined curves in exercises
- [ ] bela style squeeze theorem examples (Math 112H Fall 2020)
- [ ] update derivative application exercises page to include things like LH rule, qualities of graphs, extremal values, etc..
