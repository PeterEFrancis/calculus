\section{The Indefinite Integral}

Since the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that we have to understand anti-derivatives in order to compute definite integrals, this chapter will focus on this task.

\subsection{Anti-differentiation}

So given a function $f$, how can we find a function $F$ for which $F'=f$ (an \textbf{anti-derivative} of $f$)? Unfortunately, contrary to differentiation, it is not always possible. \mar{Check out this \href{https://xkcd.com/2117}{XKCD Comic}.}

When it is possible to anti-differentiate, we write
$$F=\int f(x)\ dx$$
and call $F$ an anti-derivative of $f$. The
