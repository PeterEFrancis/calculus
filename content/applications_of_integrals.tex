\section{Applications of Integrals}

Many applications of integrals use the following heuristic idea: you have a value $A$ that you want to compute; you break the problem up into infinitesimal pieces and compute the corresponding infinitesimal value ''$dA$''; then sum up the small values by integrating
$$A=\int\ dA.$$

Understanding integrals as sums will make understanding these integral applications easier.
The first example of this you will see is computing areas. \mar{Try to find all such examples.}

\subsection{Average Values}

The average value of $f$ on $[a,b]$ is 
$$\frac{\displaystyle\int_a^bf(x)\ dx}{b-a}.$$
There are various intuitive explanations of this; here are two.

\subsubsection{Water in a tank}
Imagine water is sloshing around in a tank and the height of the water at a particular time is described by a function $f(x)$ (see the figure below).

The average value of $f(x)$ on $[a,b]$ is the height of the water once it settles. To find this height, find the area of the water $\left(\displaystyle\int_a^bf(x)\ dx\right)$ and divide by the width of the tank ($b-a$).

\subsubsection{Using the FTC and Average Slope}
Let $F$ be an antiderivative of $f$. Then the average value of $f(x)$ on $[a,b]$ is equal to the average value of $F'$ on $[a,b]$. We know how to calculate this using the slope of a secant line:
$$\frac{F(b)-F(a)}{b-a}\overset{FTC}{=}\frac{\int_a^bf(x) \ dx}{b-a}.$$


% \subsection{Reimann Sums}
% The average of $f$ on a finite set $A=\{x_1,\dots, x_n\}$ is the sum of $f(x)$ evaluated at every element of $A$, divided by the number of elements of $A$:
% $$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i)}{n}.$$
\mar{Use Reimann sums to get another explanation.}


\subsection{Areas}
To compute the area $A$ between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ on $[a,b]$, imagine dividing up the area into infinitesimally small strips, each with height $f(x)-g(x)$ and (infinitesimal) width $dx$. The area of the strip is therefore $dA=(f(x)-g(x))\ dx$. One such strip is shown on the graph below (the width enlarged to be visible). To compute the desired area, simply integrate $dA$ over $[a,b]$:
$$A=\int dA = \int_a^b(f(x)-g(x))\ dx.$$

\subsection{Arc Length}

The \textbf{arc length} of $f(x)$ on $[a,b]$ is the length of string needed to trace the graph of $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$. Similarly to computing areas, to compute the arc length $L$ of a function $f$'s graph, divide the length into infinitesimally short segments (that we assume to be linear). Then each segment's length can be computed using the pythagorean theorem (see picture below): 
$$dL=\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}=\sqrt{1+\frac{dy^2}{dx^2}}\ dx=\sqrt{1+f'(x)^2}\ dx.$$
Then to compute the arc length $L$, sum $dL$ over $[a,b]$ by integrating:
$$L=\int_a^b\sqrt{1+f'(x)^2}\ dx.$$

\subsection{Probability}

Imagine we have an experiment, and every time it is performed the outcome is a real number. (Think throwing a dart at the plane, and the outcome is the $x$ coordinate of the point it lands on). 

To start, the we will define an \textbf{event} to be a subset of $\R$. Given such a subset $A\subset\R$, our goal is to describe the probability that the outcome $X$ is in $A$. We denote this $\P(X\in A)$.


For the kinds of experiments we will consider, we will assume that it is never possible to get the same outcome twice. This means that the probability of any \textit{particular} outcome is 0: for any $a\in\R$, $$\P(X\in\{a\})=\P(X=a)=0.$$ 
This might seem paradoxical, because the dart must hit \textit{some} point. However, it should make sense since there are infinitely many possible outcomes.
\mar{Think about this carefully.}

To compute $\P(X\in A)$ in general, we need a way to describe an allocation of probability specific to the experiment that is happening. For this (of course) we use a a function! A bounded function $f:\R \to \R$ is called a \textbf{probability density function} (PDF) if it is non-negative and $\int_{\infty}^\infty f(x)\ dx= 1$.\mar{What does the condition $$\int_{\infty}^\infty f(x)\ dx= 1$$ mean in terms of probability?} 
To compute a probability, we just have to integrate:
$$\P(X\in A) = \int_A f(x)\ dx.$$
This notation means that if $A$ is the union of disjoint intervals, integrate over each interval and add the results. In particular, if $A=(a,b)$, then 
$$\P(X\in A) = \int_a^b f(x)\ dx.$$

Here are some examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``uniform'' PDF on $(0,1)$ is defined as

$$f(x)=\begin{cases}1 & 0\leq x\leq 1\\ 0 & x<0\text{ or }x>1.\end{cases}$$

The probability that an outcome of an experiment governed by this PDF is greater than $1/4$ is
$$\P\left(X\in(1/4,\infty)\right)
= \int_{\frac14}^{\infty}f(x)\ dx
= \int_{\frac14}^{1}1\ dx + \int_{1}^{\infty}0\ dx 
= \frac34.
$$
The probability that an outcome is in $(0,1/2)\cup(2/3,1)$ is
$$\P\left(X\in(0,1/2)\cup(2/3,1)\right)
= \int_0^{\frac12}1\ dx + \int_{\frac23}^11\ dx
= \frac12+\frac13 = \frac56.
$$

\item  The ``exponential'' PDF is defined as
$$f(x)=\begin{cases}0 & x < 0\\ e^{-x} & x\geq 0\end{cases}$$
 and is often used to model the wait time between phone calls. The probability that an outcome of an experiment governed by this PDF is greater than $1/4$ is
$$\P\left(X\in(1/4,\infty)\right)
= \int_{\frac14}^{\infty} e^{-x}\ dx
= e^{-\frac{1}{4}}.
$$
