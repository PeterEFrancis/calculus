\section{Sequences}

A \textbf{sequence} of is an ordered and infinite list. A sequence of real numbers can be thought of as a function whose domain is the positive integers $\N=\{1,2,3,\dots\}$ and codomain is $\R$. For example, 
$$a=(1,4,-7,\pi,0,\dots)$$
is a sequence where $a_2=a(2)=4$. Sometimes a sequence is written $(a_n)$.

Sequences can be defined by a formula in terms of the index $n$, or with a recursive formula, by specifying the first few terms, and then defining the subsequent terms using the previous. For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item The sequence $a$ defined by $a_n=n^2$ is $(1,4,9,16,25,\dots)$.
\item The sequence $a$ defined by $a_1=a_2=1$ and $a_n=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$ is the Fibonacci sequence $(1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,\dots)$.
\end{itemize}

The limit of a sequence $a_n$ can be evaluated just as the limit of a function $f(n)=a_n$. It is written 
$$\lim a_n = \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n.$$
