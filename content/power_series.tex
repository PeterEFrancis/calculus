\section{Power Series}

% A \textbf{power series} can  be thought of as an infinite-degree polynomial. There are several uses of power series, but we will focus on power series that arise as approximations of other functions.


\subsection{Taylor and Maclaurin Series}
% Previously, you learned that ``near $x=a$'',
% $$f(x)\approx $$
